# Coding-challenge

This repository serves as a demonstration of a full-stack task.

## Project Overview

Within this repository, you will find both front-end and back-end projects. The primary objective is to create a comprehensive Products page within the context of an e-commerce platform. Our aim is to showcase the seamless integration of these two components, thereby providing users with an efficient and user-friendly experience when browsing and interacting with various products within the platform.

## Front-end Implementation

For the front-end portion of this project, we have employed Angular v14.0.0 as our chosen framework. Additionally, we have utilized PrimeNg UI components to enhance the user interface and deliver an aesthetically pleasing and intuitive front-end experience.

## Front-end Development server

To get started with the front-end development server:

1. Make sure to install all the required packages using `npm install`.

2. Run `ng serve` to launch the development server. You can access the front-end application at `http://localhost:4200/`.

3. To run unit tests, use the command `ng test`.

## Back-end Implementation

In the back-end portion of this project, we have employed Express, a popular web application framework for Node.js, along with TypeScript to ensure a robust and scalable architecture.

To store and manage data, we have integrated MongoDB as our database solution. This combination of technologies ensures efficient data handling and processing on the server-side, further contributing to the overall performance and functionality of our e-commerce platform.

# Back-end Development server

To set up the back-end development server:

1. Ensure that you've installed all the required packages using `npm install`.

2. In your terminal, run `npm run seedData` to create the necessary collection in the database and insert data.

3. Start your MongoDB server by running `mongod`.

Finally, `run npm start` to launch the back-end server. The server will be accessible at `http://localhost:8000`.
